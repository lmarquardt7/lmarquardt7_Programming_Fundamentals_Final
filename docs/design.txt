* My text document is very long due to the fact that I did defining diagrams,
  Solution algorithms, and testing for each one of my three Mad-Libs contained
  in my "website". Thank You.


Lab Problem Statement

I would like to create a web based series of Mad-Libs. First the program will 
alert the user a welcome message once they pick the madlib they want. Next the
program prompts the user to enter keywords, such as nouns, plural nouns, 
verbs, etc., that will be missing from a short story, but if it is the first prompt
of that keyword the prompt will be a little more informative. If the user tries to
leave a prompt blank, the program will alert the user that they must answer all 
prompts by sending a warning message. When all prompts are complete, the program 
will once again alert the user they are done entering text with a completed message. 
The program will then take the user-entered keywords and compile them into a full story. The 
program will then display the story.

NOUNS:

  completed alert, story

VERBS:
  alert, prompt, compile, display
